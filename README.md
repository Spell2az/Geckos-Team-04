# Development

## Git Branches

 - master - Current production release. Updated only from development branch PRs.
 - dev - Candidate for next release, nothing gets pushed into this branch. Code gets tested and undergoes peer review before being pulled into this branch from other developer branches.
 - developer branches - 4 types of branches: feature, bug, refactor and style. This is where work gets done, when creating branch, type is specified first followed by a name like so `feature/carousel` and as Waffle is used to track progress add number of the issue `feature/carousel-#13.
