    <p>
      Access to and use of the Platform is available only to individuals who are at least 18 years
      old and can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. By accessing or using the
      Platform, you represent and warrant that you are eligible.
    </p>

    <p>
      By registering or using the Platform to offer, post or provide Pro Services, Service Members
      represent and warrant that they, and the employees, agents, contractors, and subcontractors
      who may perform work for them, are properly and fully qualified and experienced, and licensed,
      certified, bonded, and insured, as required by applicable laws or regulations to which they
      may be subject in the jurisdiction(s) in which they offer their Pro Services and in relation
      to the specific job they are performing.{' '}
    </p>

    <p>
      Thumbtack is not in the business of providing Pro Services. Service Members understand and
      agree that by creating and maintaining an account on the Platform, they receive only the
      ability to use the Thumbtack Platform to access persons interested in receiving Pro Services
      and related tools, including but not limited to the ability to message Customer Members or
      schedule appointments, that facilitate the provision of Pro Services. Service Members
      understand and agree that using the Platform does not guarantee that any Thumbtack users will
      engage them for Pro Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      Service Members understand and agree that they are customers of Thumbtack, and are not
      Thumbtack employees, joint venturers, partners, or agents. Service Members acknowledge that
      they set or confirm their own prices, provide their own equipment, and determine their own
      work schedule. Thumbtack does not control, and has no right to control, the services a Service
      Member provides (including how the Service Member provides such services) if the Service
      Member is engaged by a Customer Member, except as specifically noted herein.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thumbtack, as permitted by applicable laws, obtains reports based on publicly available
      information regarding Service Members, which may include history of criminal convictions or
      sex offender registration, and we may limit, block, suspend, deactivate, or cancel a Service
      Member’s account based on the results of such a check. As a Service Member, you agree and
      authorize us to use your personal information, such as your full name and date of birth, to
      obtain such reports from Thumbtack’s vendors.
    </p>

      credentials (your "Third-Party Site Password"). You agree to provide accurate, current, and

      applicable, your Third-Party Site Password. You are solely responsible for all activity that
