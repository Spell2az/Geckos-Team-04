    <p>Access to and use of the Platform is available only to individuals who are
        at least 18 years old and can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. By accessing
                or using the Platform, you represent and warrant that you are eligible.</p>

    <p>By registering or using the Platform to offer, post or
        provide Pro Services, Service Members represent and warrant that they, and the
        employees, agents, contractors, and subcontractors who may perform work for them, are properly

        by applicable laws or regulations to which they may be subject in the jurisdiction(s) in which
                they offer their Pro Services and in relation to the specific job they are performing. </p>

    <p>Thumbtack is not in the business of providing Pro Services. Service Members understand and
        agree that by creating and maintaining an account on the Platform, they receive only the

        information regarding Service Members, which may include history of criminal convictions
        or sex offender registration, and we may limit, block, suspend, deactivate, or cancel a
        Service Member’s account based on the results of such a check. As a Service Member, you
        agree and authorize us to use your personal information, such as your full name and date
                of birth, to obtain such reports from Thumbtack’s vendors.</p>

    <h3>DISPUTES BETWEEN OR AMONG USERS</h3>

    <p>Thumbtack values our Pros and Customers, and we
        understand that occasionally disputes may arise between or among them. Our goal is to provide
        tools to help users resolve such disputes independently. In the rare event a dispute initiated
        by either a Service Member or a Customer Member cannot be resolved independently,
        you agree, at Thumbtack's request, to participate with good faith, to the extent you
        are reasonably able to do so, in a neutral resolution, mediation, or arbitration process
        conducted by Thumbtack or a neutral third-party mediator or arbitrator selected by Thumbtack.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that Thumbtack is under no
        obligation to become involved in or impose resolution in any dispute between or among
                users or any third party.</p>

    <h3 id="ARBITRATION-AND-CLASS-ACTION-WAIVER">ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h3>

    <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL
                RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</strong></p>

    <p>You and Thumbtack agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and
        that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these
                arbitration provisions.</p>

    <p>This Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all
        disputes between us, including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any
        aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
        misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this Agreement or any
        prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and claims that
                may arise after the termination of this Agreement. <strong>The only disputes
excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and
                small court claims, as provided below.</strong></p>

    <p>By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with
                Thumbtack as follows:</p>

    <p><em>Initial Dispute Resolution:</em> Most disputes can be
        resolved without resort to litigation. You can reach Thumbtack's support department at
                <a href="mailto:support@thumbtack.com">support@thumbtack.com</a>. Except for intellectual
property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to
settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with
the Thumbtack support department, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either
                party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>

    <p><em>Binding Arbitration:</em> If the parties do not reach an
        agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute
        resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party
        may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set
        forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the
        Terms' or Privacy Policy's formation, performance, and breach), the parties' relationship with
        each other, and/or your use of the Platform shall be finally settled by binding arbitration
        administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for
        claims that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures
        for claims exceeding $250,000 in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated,
        excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator,
        and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to
        resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability,
        enforceability, or formation of these Terms or the Privacy Policy, including but not
        limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms or Privacy Policy is void or
        voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation
        conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a
        court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be written and shall be binding
        on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
        To start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) write a Demand for Arbitration that
        includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may
                find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a>
      ); (b) send three copies of the
      Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center,
      Suite 1500, San Francisco, California 94111; and (c) send one copy of the Demand for
      Arbitration to Thumbtack at 1355 Market Street, Suite 600, San Francisco, California 94103,
                ATTN: Legal.</p>

    <p>To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing
        a lawsuit, Thumbtack will pay the additional cost. If the
        arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Thumbtack will pay the fees invoiced by
        JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your
                own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.</p>

    <p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision,
        they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that,
        in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right
                to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>

    <p>If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you
        reside at the time of filing. For individuals residing outside the United States,
        arbitration shall be initiated in the State of California, United States of America, and you
        and Thumbtack agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San
        Francisco County, California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending
        arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the
                arbitrator.</p>

    <p><em>Class Action Waiver:</em> The parties further agree that
        the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class
        action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a
                class action or seek relief on a class basis. <strong>YOU AND THUMBTACK AGREE
THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT
AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
                PROCEEDING.</strong> If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set
forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can
proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null
and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate
                disputes.</p>

    <p><em>Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims
                Court Claims:</em> Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes
through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity
determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use
of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights ("intellectual
property rights" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but
not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small
claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's
                jurisdiction.</p>

    <p><em>30-Day Right to Opt Out:</em> You have the right to opt
        out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by
        sending (from the email address you use on Thumbtack) written notice of your decision to opt
                out to <a href="mailto:opt-out@thumbtack.com">opt-out@thumbtack.com</a> with the subject line, "ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT."
The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Platform; otherwise,
you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If
you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Thumbtack also will not be bound by
                them.</p>


    <p><em>Changes to This Section:</em> Thumbtack will provide
        thirty (30) days' notice of any changes to this section by posting on
                the <a href="https://www.thumbtack.com/terms/">Thumbtack Terms of Use website</a>,
sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you
when you are logged into your account. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days
                after they are posted on the Thumbtack Terms of Use website or sent to you.</p>

    <p>Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after
        the thirtieth (30th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on "Changes
        to This Section" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the
        section entitled “Arbitration and Class Action Waiver,” and the court or arbitrator shall
        apply the first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began
                using the Platform.</p>

    <p><em>Survival</em>: This Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
                section shall survive any termination of your Account or the Platform.</p>

    <h3>GOVERNING LAW</h3>

    <p>The Terms and the relationship between you and Thumbtack shall be governed
        in all respects by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law
        provisions. You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against Thumbtack that is not
        subject to arbitration must be resolved by a court located in San Francisco County, San
        Francisco, California, or a United States District Court, Northern District of California,
        located in San Francisco, California, except as otherwise agreed by the parties. You agree to
        submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County,
        California or the United States District Court, Northern District of California located in San
        Francisco, California, for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes that are not
        subject to arbitration. You hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses
                otherwise available.</p>

        third-party claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation
        reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your
                violation of these Terms.</p>

    <p>If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section
                1542, which provides:</p>

    <p><em>A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor
        does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release,
        which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the
                debtor.</em></p>

    <p>If you are not a California resident, you waive your rights under any
        statute or common law principle similar to Section 1542 that governs your rights in the
                jurisdiction of your residence.</p>

    <h3>GENERAL</h3>

    <p><em>Force Majeure</em>: Other than payment obligations,
        neither Thumbtack nor you shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure in performance
        under the Terms arising out of a cause beyond its control and without its fault or negligence.
        Such causes may include but are not limited to fires, floods, earthquakes, strikes,
        unavailability of necessary utilities, blackouts, acts of God, acts of declared or undeclared
                war, acts of regulatory agencies, or national disasters.</p>

    <p><em>No Third-Party Beneficiaries</em>: You agree that,
        except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there shall be no third-party
                beneficiaries to these Terms.</p>

    <p><em>Contacting You and E-SIGN Consent</em>: You agree that
        Thumbtack may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by
        email, regular mail, or postings on the Platform. With your consent, Thumbtack or Service
        Members may also contact you by telephone or through text messages. If you have agreed to
        receive text messages or telephone calls from Thumbtack or Service Members, you also consent to
        the use of an electronic record to document your agreement. You may withdraw your
        consent to the use of the electronic record by sending an email to

    <p><em>Entire Agreement</em>: These Terms, together with the
        Privacy Policy and any other legal notices or additional terms and conditions or
        policies published by Thumbtack on the Platform, shall constitute the entire
        agreement between you and Thumbtack concerning the Platform or Pro Services obtained through
        the Platform. Except as explicitly stated herein, if any provision of
        the Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such
        provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Terms, which shall
                remain in full force and effect.</p>

    <p><em>Waiver</em>: No waiver of any provision of these Terms
        shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and
        Thumbtack's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a
                waiver of such right or provision.</p>

    <p><em>Statute of Limitations</em>: You agree that regardless
        of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim arising out of or related to the Platform or
        the Pro Services offered therein must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action
        accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. Notwithstanding
                the foregoing, this statute of limitations shall not apply to residents of New Jersey.</p>

    <p><em>Section Headings</em>: The section headings in these
                Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
